# What is this?
A playground for exploring data from the r package [rpredictit](www.github.com/seakintruth/rpredictit)
that uses the predictit.org api - and some web scrapping from the same site. 

# Loading the dataset
This dataset is stored in a sqlite database. These and other files exceed GitHub's 100 mb file size limit. We are using the git-lfs tool to work around this limitation, but that means that after cloning this repository you will need to install git-lfs and then run git lfs pull

For Ununtu that's
```
sudo apt install git-lfs
git clone https://github.com/seakintruth/rpredictit_dataset.git
git lfs pull
```

# Here be dragons!
Don't expect any of this code to work as expected, it's a playground! (Lots of bugs)
