# What is this?
A playground for exploring data from the r package [rpredictit](www.github.com/seakintruth/rpredictit)
that uses the predictit.org api - and some web scrapping from the same site. 

# Here be dragons!
Don't expect any of this code to work as expected, it's a playground! (Lots of bugs)
